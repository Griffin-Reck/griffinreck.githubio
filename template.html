<h1> Battle Souls</h1>
<hr>
<div>Welcome to Battle Souls. This is a adventure click based game that I have created. This is my first ever website/game that I have created so I hope you enjoy. Here is the story: You wake up only to find out that you are starving and are located somewhere in the woods far from home. You can scream for help to see if anyone will hear you and come toward you to save you. You can stay where you are in hope that people will realize you are missing and go look for you. You can look for food since you are starving and if you don't eat you could die. Or you can walk towards a campfire that you see and look to see if people are there.</div>
